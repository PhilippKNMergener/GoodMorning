# GoodMorning
*Morning Routine iOS App*

## Project Motivation
Starting the day off on social media puts me in a non-productive mindset for the morning
I use my phone as an alarm and sleep tracker so I can't just leave it outside my bedroom
*(customizable alarm clocks with sleep tracking are expensive, many sleep apps on the other hand, are free)*
I wanted an app that I could open in the morning instead of instagram or youtube to start my day off in the right mindset
Something simple that gave a little mindfulness without eating up too much time
this App is my attempt at that idea

## About the Project
***GoodMorning*** is an iOS app created using the SwiftUI framework
It is focused on satisfying animations and simplicity for a better start to the morning
The main goal for the app is to be aesthetically pleasing, without too much for the eyes to stick to 
It should be a straightfoward and easy experience that is repeatable every morning.
This is not only an idea which I would personally use in my everyday life, 
but also simplistic enough to help me learn SwiftUI as I am still a beginner in using the framework.
